# kafka-pubsub-poc

POC of a pubsub app using Kafka. It follows the [confluent examples](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/tutorials/examples/clients/docs/clojure.html) 
to define a [consumer](https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/blob/7.0.1-post/clients/cloud/clojure/src/io/confluent/examples/clients/clj/consumer.clj) 
and a [producer](https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/blob/7.0.1-post/clients/cloud/clojure/src/io/confluent/examples/clients/clj/producer.clj).

## Usage

### From command line

You can run either components with the name of the config file at the `resources` directory and the name of the topic:
```clj
;; To run the consumer
lein consumer java.config <topic name>

;; To run the producer
lein producer java.config <topic name>
```

The producer will publish 10 messages for test purpose.

## From Intellij

There are scripts in the directory `.run` that allow you to run either components. You just need to choose one of them
from the dropdown menu and press play üõÄüèΩ.
